---


## 13.如何用好比较结构
### 比较句，其实并不是状语从句，而是一种特殊的并列句
- Mary `is beautiful` and Lucy `is beautiful` too.
- 这是一个并列句，两句话的系表部分都是"is beautiful"
- 那么，如果你要表达：“Mary和Lucy一样漂亮”，就称为`原级比较`:
- Mary is `as beautiful as` Lucy (is beautiful).
- 前面一个as是副词，后面一个as才是连词，括号里边的部分和前面的分句相同，故通常省略。
- 如果你要表达:“Mary比Lucy漂亮”， 就称为`一般比较`:
- Mary `is more beautiful` than Lucy.

### 原级比较：as(副词)+形容词或副词的原级...as (连词) ...
- 概述
    - 出现在“as...as...”(和...一样)的句子中，第一个as为副词，第二个as为副词连词，引导比较状语从句
    - 此时，整个比较结构，可以作表语，定语（形容词比较），也可以作状语（副词比较）
    - 在否定句中，也可用“not so...as...”
        - He is handsome.
        - John is handsome.
        - 可合并为：He is as handsome as John is handsome
        - 为了避免重复，第二个as后面相同的部分(动词及动词以后的词)均可省略。如果后面的主语是代词时，书面语用主格，但是口语可使用宾格。
        - 故这句话可改为:
        - He is as handsome as John. 他和约翰一样帅!
    - 在书面语中，尤其是主语为代词时，为了避免选择主格/宾格的麻烦，最好不要省略比较连词后面的动词（口语中可省略）
    - He is as handsome as John `is`
    - He is as handsome as you `are`
    - He is as handsome as I `am`
- 形容词原级比较
    - Pigs are `as clever as monkeys and dolphins.` (表语比较) 猪和猴子以及海豚一样聪明。
    - People are `not so honest as they once were.` (表语比较) 人们不再像以前那样诚实了。
    - 注:形容词后可接名词(定语比较)
        - Jane is `as a beautiful girl as` Mary. 简和玛丽一样是个漂亮女孩。
- 副词原级比较
    - David works `as hard as` Bill. 大卫和比尔一样努力。
    - Mary reads `as much as` Tony watches television. 玛丽看书的时间和托尼看电视的时间一样多。
    - I can't keep a secret `as long as` he/him. 我不能像他一样保守那么久的秘密
- 尽量...：as + adj./adv. + as possible/one can
    - You should be `as careful as you can` when driving. = You should be `as careful as possible` when driving. 你开车要尽量小心。
    - The woman kept `as near as she could` to the children and even tried to get into the case herself, but it was too small. 这位妇女尽可能地靠近孩子，甚至自己也想钻进箱子里去，只是箱子太小了。
- 极为...：be as + adj. + as can be
    - That girl is `as beautiful as can be.` 那个女孩子美丽极了。
- 和往常一样...：as + adj./adv. + as ever + as one used to be
    - I rang the bell and was not surprised to see that Herbert was still `as fat as ever.`  我按响了门铃，当看到休仍和往常一样胖时，我并不感到惊奇。
    - Jack is working `as hard as ever.` 杰克和往常一样努力工作。
    - Jay Chou is `not so popular as he used to be.` 周杰伦没有以前那么红了。
- 多达...：as many as + 数字 + 复合名词
    - `As many as` 20,000 people were killed or missing in a massive tsunami in Japan on March 11, 2011. 多达2万人在2011年3月11日的日本大海啸中丧生和失踪。
    - 注：修饰金额时，一律用as much as
    - I have `as much as` 100 dollars with me. 我身上多达100美元。
    - 类似搭配有：as long as长达，as wide as宽达，as high as高达
- 造句练习
    - 1.要想把英文学好，你应该尽量多看英文文章。
        - 1.To learn English well, you should read as many English articles as possible.
    - 2.我每次见到大卫，他都像蜜蜂一样忙着工作。
        - 2.Whenever I see David, he is as busy working as a bee.
    - 3.彼得或许没有玛丽那么聪明，但是他勤奋(hardworking)极了。
        - 3.Peter may be not so/as clever as Mary, but he is as hardworking as can be.
    - 4.这名歌手不像以前那么受欢迎了。
        - 4.The singer is not so/as popular as he used to be.
    - 5.估计多达10万名考生将参加新托福考试。
        - 5.It is estimated that as many as one hundred thousand candidates will take the IBT.
    - 6.我学英文长达十年之久。
        - 6.I've been learning English as long as ten years.

### 比较级比较(一般)：形容词或副词的比较级...than (连词)...
- 概述
    - 情况一
        - 1.A is beautiful.
        - 2.B is beautiful.
        - 如果要表达“A比B更漂亮”，就需要将上面两个句子合并:
        - A is more beautiful than B is beautiful.
        - A is more beautiful than B is.
        - A is more beautiful than B.
        - 那么问题来了，than后面的句子，动词is省略好还是不省略好呢?
        - 很简单，than后 面的句子中的动词和前面完全一致， 那就可以省略，但是如果`不一致`，比如is变成了am, are, was, were等形式，那就不能省略。如果是一般动词，应以do, does, did代替)。
        - Mary is more beautiful than Jane.
        - John is more handsome than I `am`.
    - 情况二
        - 1.I like her.
        - 2.You like her.
        - 如果要表达“我比你更喜欢她”，那么两句合并:
        - I like her more than you like her.
        - 此时，如果省略动词: I like her more than you. (意思是我喜欢她胜过喜欢你)
        - 那么，就出现歧义了，到底是“我比你更喜欢她”还是“我更喜欢她而不喜欢你呢?因为“you”既可能是主格也可能是宾格。事实上，英文中所有的实义名词都是“主格”与“宾格”相同的。
        - 所以，上面的句子应该写成: I like her more than you do. (我比你更喜欢她)
- 形容词一般比较
    - Bill Frith's garden is `larger than Joe's`. 比尔.弗里斯的花园比乔的花园大。
    - Wisdom is `more precious than wealth.` 智慧比财富更宝贵。
    - Athlete need to consume `much more food than the average person.` 运动员比一般人需要消耗更多的食物。
    - Taking a beautiful fall is `better than wondering aimlessly`. 华丽的跌倒，胜过无谓的徘徊。
    - Indifference and neglect often do `much more damage than outstraight dislike`. 冷漠和忽视经常比直接的憎恨伤害更大。(J.K .Rowling名言)
- 副词一般比较
    - Bill works `harder than Joe` and grows more flowers and vegetables, but Joe's garden is more interesting. 他比乔也更为勤奋，种植的花卉和蔬菜也更多，但乔的花园更富有情趣。
    - Actions speak `louder than words.` 行动胜于空谈。
    - 比较级可以被副词much, even, still, far, a lot修饰，表示"...得多"，或者a bit, a little修饰，表示“...一点点”。
    - 比较级前面加上all the，表示“更加...”，是一种强调，相当于even, much
        - The food was `all the` more delicious because we were hungry. = The food was `even/much` more delicious because we were hungry. 因为我们饿了，食物就更加美味可口。

### 准关系代词as, than, but引导的定语从句
- 概述
    - 对比两个句子:
    - 1.我们了解到`他通过了考试。`
    - 2.`正如我们了解到的那样`，他通过了考试。
    - 我们会发现，上面两句话其实是同一个意思。英语中，也有和上面完全对应的说法:
    - 1.We learned `that he passed the exam.`
    - 2.`As we learned,` he passed the exam.
- as引导的定语从句
    - 概述
        - 传统语法认为：as通常 用于引导非限定性定语从句，此时as代替整个主句，相当于which。这种说法显然比较牵强附会，造成很多英语学习者理解困难。其实这种句型同样属于比较状语从句，只不过as后面省略了复合关系代词what，只要知道了这点，马上就能理解了。
        - `As (what / the thing that) I soon learnt,` he was English himself! 我很快了解到，他自己就是个英国人!
        - 主动式：`As I soon learnt`, he was English himself.
        - 被动式：`As was soon learnt (by me),` he was English himself.
        - 注意，本从句的谓语动词必须是及物动词！！而且主句必须是这个及物动词`逻辑上的宾语`
        - 上一句话，learn是及物动词，后面的主句he was English himself. 刚好就是learn的逻辑宾语
    - 例句
        - But `as they soon discovered,` disguises can sometimes be too perfect. 但他们很快就发觉，化装的效果有时过分完美了。
        - Anyway, `as Brian pointed out,` it is the easiest thing in the world to give up smoking. 不管怎么说，正如布赖恩指出的那样，戒烟是世界上最容易的事情。
        - `As is known to us all,` the whale is not fish but mammal. 就像我们都知道的一样，鲸不是鱼类而是哺乳动物。
        - She was married again, `as was expected.`她又结婚了，正如人们预料的一样。
        - `As is reported,` it is 100 years since Tsing University was founded. 正如报道的那样，清华大学建校已经有100年历史了。
    - 造句练习
        - 1.正如她工作表现出的一样，她很细心。
            - 1.She is very careful, as her work shows.
        - 2.就像我们猜测的一样，这个调皮的学生没有通过考试。
            - 2.As we guessed, the naughty student didn't pass the exam.
        - 3.正如常常被指出的，知识是一把双刃剑，可以同等地用于造福和作恶。
            - 3.As is so often pointed out, knowledge is a two-edged weapon which can be used equally for good or evil.
- that引导的定语从句
    - 概述
        - 先看这句话:
        - He smoked more cigarettes `than` were normally available. 他吸的香烟比他弄到的要多。
        - 如果按照传统语法把than看成关系代词，是很难理解的。但是，只要我们按照下面的方式理解，就是一目了然了:
        - He smoked more cigarettes than (what) were normally available.
        - 这里，than后面省略 了复合关系代词what,这样理解，立刻就能符合我们的正常思维方式。
    - 例句
        - Don't drink more wine than is good for health. 不要过量饮酒，适量饮酒有益于健康。
        - I have more money than he needs. 我的钱比他需要的多。
        - He is a good student than you are. 他是个好学生，比你还好。
        - The manufacturers had to pay more money than they had anticipated, for they bought the biscuit from the student for $24,000. 饼干公司不得不付出比他们预计多得多的钱，因为为买下那学生烘制的饼干他们支付了24,000美元。
        - To compensate for his unpleasant experiences in hospital, the man drank a little more than was good for him. 为了补偿住院这一段不愉快的经历，那人喝得稍许多了一点。
        - It seems that man was making a real effort to understand the seasons 20,000 years earlier than has been supposed. 看来人类早就致力于探索四季变迁了，比人们想象的要早20,000年。
    - 造句练习
        - 1.人们现在准备饭菜比以前容易多了。
            - 1.People today can prepare their meal much easier than has ever been before.
        - 2.父母最好别给孩子太多的钱，够用就行了。
            - 2.Parents had better not give kids more money than is needed.
        - 3.所以今天想在某一领域成为专业人士要比以前花费更长的时间。
            - 3.Therefore, to be a professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before.
- but引导的定语从句
    - but作为准关系代词引导定语从句，是一种少见的用法，且只引导`限定性定语从句`。而且要特别注意，but本身具有否定意义，故引导的定语从句具有`否定含义`。另外，but修饰的先行词，通常会被否定词修饰。且这个结构通常只能和there be句型搭配
        - There is no man but errs.人必犯错。(but作主语，相当于There is no man who doesn't err.)
        - There is nothing but he knows.没有他不知道的事情。(but作宾语，相当于There is nothing which he doesn't know.)
    - 造句练习
        - 1.在场的人没人不知道这个故事
            - 1.There was no one present but knew the story already .
        - 2.没有不爱自己孩子的母亲
            - 2. There is no mother but loves her children.

## 14.如何写好倒装句和强调句
### 概述
- 所谓倒装句，就是改变句子主干的正常顺序，达到强调其中一部分内容的目的

    - 句中有be动词或者助动词的时候，将其与主语倒装
    - 句中只有一般动词的时候，根据人称和时态在主语前加上do, does, did
- 否定性质的副词
    - never(从不)
        - **Never** `is he` happy. 他从不快乐。(原句是：He is never happy)
    - hardly/scarcely(几乎不)
        - **Hardly** `is he` ever quiet. 他几乎从未安静过。(原句是: He is hardly ever quiet.)
    - rarely/seldom(很少)

        - `In no way` am I responsible for what has happened. 我决不对发生的事情负责。(原句是: I am in no way responsible for what has happened. )
    - not until/only + 副词性质的短语或从句：直到.../就在...
        - `Not until` John arrived `did I` leave.直到约翰到了之后我才离开。(原句: I did not leave until John arrived. )
        - `Only` in a sparsely-populated rural community `is it` possible to disregard it. 只有在人口稀少的农村，才可以忽视它。(原句: It is possible to disregard it only in a sparsely-populated rural community. )
    - 并列句里面的not only...but(also/...as well)（不仅...而且...）句型，在`连接两个完整的句子`时，要使用倒装。注：第二个句子不倒装，但also要省略
        - **Not only** `was the meal` well below the usual standard, but Bessie seemed unable to walk steadily.不仅饭菜远不如平时做得好，而且贝西走起路来似乎东倒西歪。(原句是：The meal was not only well below the .....)

- 造句练习：(分别用正常语序和倒装)

### so/such倒装句
- 形容词一般比较
    - He is `so` helpful that we all like him. = `So` helpful `is he` that we all like him.他那么乐于助人，因此我们都很喜欢她。
    - He has done `so` well that he deserves our respect. = So well has he done that he deserves our respect.他做得那么好，所以值得我们尊敬。

- so作为副词单独使用可表示“也”的意思，前面有连词and，后面的句子倒装
    - I'm afraid of darkness, and my sister is, too. = I'm afraid of darkness, and so is my sister.我怕黑，我妹妹也是。
- 造句练习：(分别用正常语序和倒装)

        - President Obama will be coming to see us tomorrow, and so will his wife.

### nor / and neither倒装句
- nor和neither都表示“也不”，但nor是连词，而neither是副词，所以前面通常有连词and。（美语中有时也可省略）
    - My girlfriend doesn't like singing, and I don't, either.
    - = My girlfriend doesn't like singing, nor do I.
    - = My girlfriend doesn't like singing, and neither do I.

        - 1.I will not attend the meeting tomorrow, and our boss will not, either.
        - I wiII not attend the meet ing tomorrow, and neither will our boss .
        - I will not attend the meeting tomorrow, nor will our boss.
    - 2.这条消息也不是特别地令人吃惊。
        - 2.The news is not particularly surprising.
        - Nor is the news particularly surprising.

### 副词倒装句
- 表示地点、方向、次序的副词放在句首，主语是名词，谓语是系动词或不及物动词的时候，必须倒装（主语是代词不倒装）
    - **Up** `came the sun` as we climbed to the mountain top. 太阳在我们爬到山顶时升起。(完全倒装)
    - **On the desk** `is a book.` 桌上有本书(完全倒装)
    - **Among them** `will be debbie's mother,` who swam the Channel herself when she was a girl. 他们当中还会有黛比的母亲，她本人还是个姑娘时，也曾横渡过英吉利海峡! (本句中 的mother被定语从句修饰，故倒装以后和紧邻定语从句，使句子主干更突出)
    - **Next** `came a horse.` 随后来了一匹马。
    - **There** `you have` it that's the news for today.(不倒装)
    - **On the hill** `I saw` Lulu.(不倒装)
- There be句型，其实是一种特殊的地点副词倒装句，翻译为“有...”，其本质是强调某种东西“存在”，be这时是一个不及物动词，相当于exist。而动词have的本质是强调“拥有”
    - `There is` only one happiness in this life, to love and to be loved.生命中只有一种情况叫幸福——爱和被爱。 (法国作家 乔治桑名言)
    - `There will be` a large basketball match in our school next week.我们学校下周将有一场大型篮球比赛。
    - `There have been` bicycles stolen from the parking lot recently. 最近停车场一直有自行车遭窃。
    - Many people wonder if `there might be` life in other galaxies.很多人想知道其它星系是否可能有生命存在。
- 某些语法书说，have的主语是人，There be的主语是物*。这种说法显然是错误的。大家一定要记住：have是从属关系，there be仅仅强调某种东西“存在”，所以there be句型的主语一定是实体名词，而不能用抽象名词比如meeting, conversation等
    - The house `has` many large rooms and there is a lovely garden.这栋房子里有许多房间，还有一个漂亮的花园。(本句里rooms属于house的组成部分，而garden属于house外的东西，故前面用has，后面用there is)

### 强调
- 普通强调句
    - 为了强调句中的某个成分，可以用下面两种句型
    - It is/was + 名词/代词 + who/whom/which引导的定语从句
    - It is/was + 副词/介词短语/状语从句 + that引导的名词从句
        - Mary is visiting us tomorrow.玛丽明天来看我们。
        - => It is Mary who is visiting us tomorrow.明天来看我们的是玛丽。
        - I bought this watch yesterday.我昨天买了这块手表。
        - => It is this watch which I bought yesterday.我昨天买的就是这块手表。
        - I quit my job because I didn't like the general manager.我辞职是因为我不喜欢总经理。
        - => It was because I didn't like the general manager that I quit my job.我是因为不喜欢总经理才辞职的。
        - The tree was planted near a church fifty years ago, but it has gained an evil reputation only in recent years.该树是50年前栽在教堂附近的，但近几年得到了一个坏名声。
        - => The tree was planted near a church fifty years ago, but it is only in recent years that it has gained an evil reputation. 该树是50年前栽在教堂附近的，但只是近几年才得到了一个坏名声。
- 注：强调句中的It is /was...who/whom/which/that在句子中不作任何成分，这是与it作形式主语的句型的区别
- 一般疑问句的强调：把is/was提到it前面
- 特殊疑问句的强调：疑问句+一般疑问句的强调句
    - `Was it` yesterday `that` he met president Obama?他是昨天遇到奥巴马总统的吗?
    - `What is it that` makes a person so special?使一个人与众不同的究竟是什么呢?
- 造句练习
    - 1.我是在公园里遇到玛丽的。
        - 1.It was in the park that I ran into Mary.
    - 2.我是为了我的健康的缘故放弃这份待遇优厚的工作的。
        - 2.It was for the sake of my health thatI gave up this well-paying job.
    - 3.是直到昨天你才完成这个工作的吗?
        - 3.Was it until yesterday that you finished the work?
    - 4.究竟是哪个国家赢得了2010年世界杯呢?
        - 4.Which country was it that won the World Cup in 2010?

## 15.介词省略句型
### 引入
- 先看几个汉语句子
    - 1、我`确信`他无法通过考试。
    - 2、我很`高兴`你来参加我们的宴会。
    - 3、我`恐怕`他不会来了。
    - 4、我很`抱歉`这么晚打扰你。
- 在汉语中是表示人的心理活动，应该是谓语动词，后面的句子是宾语
- 但是在英语中，并没有对应心理活动的动词，而是对应的表示心理活动的形容词: sure, glad, afraid, or....等等，我们将其称之为“主观形容词”
- 所以，需要一个固定搭配：be+主观形容词+ about/ of

### 后接名词
- I `am` terribly `sorry about` that.听说这事我很难过。

### 后接动名词短语
- She `is tired of` doing her homework.她对写作业感到很厌倦.
- John `has been aware of` having done something wrong.约翰已意识到自己做错了事

### 后接名词从句
- 只有whether从句和疑问句从句，才能直接作介词的宾语
    - I am worried **about** `whether he can do it.` 我很担心他是否能做这件事。
